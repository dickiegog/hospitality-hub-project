## Usage and Screenshots

## Navigation Bar

The site uses a responsive navigation bar made up of four pages these are the Home page, Owner Page, Manager's Page, and Staff Page.

A user can access the other pages on the site and see what page they are currently on by looking at the menu in the navigation bar. When the user is on a page it will show that in bold text.

The menu will be changed to use the hamburger icon for small devices. I followed the steps from the Love Running project.
